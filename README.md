# BrainfuckInterpreter
A Brainfuck interpreter made with Python.

Requires the module **readchar** to get keyboard input.
Install by running: `pip install readchar`


Can be started from a console or by double-clicking the script. File loading will be added later, currently you just copy-paste your code.

Still in development, there might be some bugs. Specifically when it comes to square brackets.
